            This site is a school project created as a part of my 3rd semester exam. I am a student at Copenhagen Business Academy, studying multimediadesign. If you want to learn more about me and my work, you can have a look at my <a href="https://sif.aagaard-svendsen.dk" target="_blank"> portfolio </a>.
            <br> The game is a tile game, I have made using JavaScript, and the site is coded in PHP, HTML, Bootstrap and SASS. 
            <br>If you want a look at the code I have put the localhost version on <a href="https://github.com/SifAa/magicforest" target="_blank">Github</a>.
